  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    Outside my studies, I enjoy mapping geographical and political conflicts, 
    exploring strategies, and staying physically active. 
    These hobbies keep both my mind and body sharp, and prepare me for future challenges.
  </p>


  <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    Duty, perseverance, and continuous growth guide my journey. Managing academics 
    alongside preparation for the forces has taught me to stay focused under pressure, 
    adapt quickly, and remain determined in the face of obstacles.
